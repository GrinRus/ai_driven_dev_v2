# Active Backlog

This file is the short actionable queue.

Use `docs/backlog/roadmap.md` for the full hierarchy and status of every wave, epic,
slice, and local task.

## Next

- `W36-E3-S1-T2` — Replace duplicate status and surface palettes with semantic color
  roles.

## Soon

- `W36-E3-S1-T3` — Define compact desktop and touch mobile density modes from shared
  control tokens.

## Parking lot

- `W36-E4-S1-T1` — Add the Project -> Work item -> Runtime -> Review/Launch onboarding
  state machine.
- `W36-E5-S1-T1` — Hide a zero-value Evidence Inspector and keep Filmstrip/log evidence
  collapsed until requested.

  conflating validation repair.
- `W36-E5-S7-T1` — Render canonical implement tasks, attempts, recovery, and aggregate
  finalization inside Studio.
- `W36-E5-S8-T1` — Implement the typed Filmstrip frame projection from durable attempts,
  task attempts, and finalization milestones.
- `W36-E5-S0-T1` — Add one core-owned recommended outcome and rationale to the terminal
  handoff read model.

  parity entries close.
- `W36-E6-S1-T1` — Add a URL-state codec for Inbox / Studio / History, work item, run,
  stage, attempt/task-attempt detail, and artifact selection.
- `W36-E6-S2-T1` — Define the scoped browser-session draft key, retention, and cleanup
  contract.
- `W36-E6-S3-T1` — Replace terminal-on-error polling with cursor-preserving retry and
  bounded backoff.
- `W36-E6-S4-T1` — Add a keyed client mutation guard with pending lock, duplicate
  suppression, conflict readback, and retryable failure state.
- `W36-E7-S1-T1` — Add the Guided Setup project validation, create/resume, runtime
  review, first-launch, and resulting Inbox browser journey.

## Update rules

- Keep `roadmap.md` as the canonical plan and `backlog.md` as the short queue.
- Only local task IDs belong in the queue sections.
- If a task is too large, split it in `roadmap.md` before coding.
- Add new work to `roadmap.md` first, then promote it here only if it becomes immediate.
- `Soon` is reserved for direct successors of tasks currently in `Next`; consciously
  deferred ready work belongs in `Parking lot`.
- Remove completed tasks rather than leaving stale queue entries behind.
- Keep one bounded current reconciliation note; Git and roadmap evidence retain history.
- If roadmap is fully `done` and this queue is empty, reopen work using the
  queue-restoration policy in `docs/backlog/roadmap.md` (`W8-E3-S1`).

## Current reconciliation

- `2026-07-17` `W36-E3-S1-T1` is complete: `operator-tokens.css` now owns semantic
  typography, spacing, radius, elevation, control-size, state, focus, and motion roles,
  while an inventory test prevents the existing raw-value surface outside the token layer
  from growing. `W36-E3-S1-T2` is promoted to `Next` and `W36-E3-S1-T3` to `Soon`.

- `2026-07-17` `W36-E2-S3-T4`, slice `W36-E2-S3`, and Epic `W36-E2` are complete:
  one pure resolver now applies the selector/rollout truth table per surface, exposes
  mixed Studio/legacy resolution without changing shared service requests, and fails
  unknown surfaces explicitly. `W36-E3-S1-T1` is promoted to `Next` and
  `W36-E3-S1-T2` to `Soon`.

- `2026-07-17` `W36-E2-S3-T3` is complete: a validated packaged manifest now assigns
  each of the twelve journey-owned surfaces exactly one slice owner, rollout state,
  rollback renderer, required fixture, browser journey, and removal gate; all entries
  begin as `legacy_only`. `W36-E2-S3-T4` is promoted to `Next`; `Soon` remains empty
  until the migration resolver is accepted.

- `2026-07-17` `W36-E2-S3-T2` is complete: the packaged browser now accepts only
  `ui=studio|legacy`, treats missing or invalid values as legacy, and records an explicit
  legacy fallback for Studio while every surface is still legacy-only; service routes and
  request payloads are unchanged. `W36-E2-S3-T3` is promoted to `Next` and
  `W36-E2-S3-T4` to `Soon`.

- `2026-07-17` `W36-E2-S3-T1` is complete: one packaged dashboard/action seam now owns
  non-next-flow loading, server-derived context reconciliation, and workflow/stage/task/
  remediation dispatch, while legacy rendering and next-flow behavior retain equivalent
  requests and durable readback. `W36-E2-S3-T2` is promoted to `Next` and
  `W36-E2-S3-T3` to `Soon`.

- `2026-07-17` `W36-E2-S2-T3` and slice `W36-E2-S2` are complete: schema-v1 browser
  evidence now atomically records bounded viewport metadata, screenshots, DOM measures,
  console/network summaries, accessibility/geometry results, and cleanup status outside
  the repository worktree. `W36-E2-S3-T1` is promoted to `Next` and `W36-E2-S3-T2` to
  `Soon`.

- `2026-07-17` `W36-E2-S2-T2` is complete: browser geometry assertions now diagnose
  sticky-header budget, first-viewport primary action, clipping, overlap, nested scroll,
  and horizontal overflow at the owning viewport and selector. `W36-E2-S2-T3` is promoted
  to `Next` and `W36-E2-S3-T1` to `Soon`.

- `2026-07-17` `W36-E2-S2-T1` is complete: the browser assertion layer now reports
  accessible-name, label, focus-order, contrast, target-size, and reduced-motion failures
  with the owning selector and measured value. `W36-E2-S2-T2` is promoted to `Next` and
  `W36-E2-S2-T3` to `Soon`.

- `2026-07-17` `W36-E2-S1-T3` and slice `W36-E2-S1` are complete: nine immutable,
  provider-free descriptors now seed canonical setup, active, recovery, quality,
  remediation, and terminal evidence through production persistence helpers and verify the
  public loopback UI without external reads. `W36-E2-S2-T1` is promoted to `Next` and
  `W36-E2-S2-T2` to `Soon`.

- `2026-07-17` `W36-E2-S1-T2` is complete: the reusable browser harness starts the public
  loopback CLI under one deadline, isolates all five contract viewports, captures browser
  and network failures, and bounds server/process cleanup plus temporary workspace removal.
  `W36-E2-S1-T3` is promoted to `Next` and `W36-E2-S2-T1` to `Soon`.

- `2026-07-17` `W36-E2-S1-T4` is complete: Python Playwright is locked only in the dev
  extra, the wheel remains runtime-clean, and a real loopback `aidd ui` Chromium smoke
  fails with the maintained install command when the browser is missing.
  `W36-E2-S1-T2` is promoted to `Next` and `W36-E2-S1-T3` to `Soon`.

- `2026-07-17` `W36-E2-S1-T1` is complete: the provider-free browser policy selects the
  Python Playwright sync API with one external-cache Chromium target, an isolated
  `browser_tests/` lane, and no Node/Vite product runtime. `W36-E2-S1-T4` is promoted to
  `Next` and `W36-E2-S1-T2` to `Soon`.

  connectivity, and mutations now have separate observable vocabularies.
  `W36-E1-S2-T3` is promoted to `Next` and `W36-E2-S1-T1` to `Soon`.

- `2026-07-17` `W36-E1-S2-T1` is complete: every setup, execution, next-flow, and archive
  action now names its real endpoint/service, durable result, and conflict boundary; eval is
  explicitly an external/manual handoff. `W36-E1-S2-T2` is promoted to `Next` and
  `W36-E1-S2-T3` to `Soon`.

- `2026-07-17` `W36-E1-S1-T3` and slice `W36-E1-S1` are complete: the local-project

  `runtime.log` persistence and documents full/tail replay plus separate structured audit
  evidence. `W36-E1-S1-T3` is promoted to `Next` and `W36-E1-S2-T1` to `Soon`.

- `2026-07-17` `W34-E8-S2-T1` is complete: target architecture now states stable
  implemented frontend, project-set, provenance, approval-audit, and immutable-run
  ownership without using a completed wave or an undecided browser driver as policy.

  terminal exclusion, and direct or explicit `Soon` succession. `W34-E8-S2-T1` is
  promoted to `Next` and `W34-E8-S2-T2` to `Soon`.

- `2026-07-17` `W34-E8-S1-T2` is complete: planning entities now use a canonical
  level-specific status vocabulary, backlog placement projects exact local-task status,

  lineage/history, wizard, readiness/error, and next-action presentation now live in
  a separately packaged view asset loaded before the remaining UI wiring.
  `W34-E7-S3-T1` is promoted from Parking lot to `Next`; `Soon` remains empty.

- `2026-07-16` `W34-E3-S4-T3` is complete: dashboard filesystem/read-model collection

  `S4-T4` is promoted to `Next`; `Soon` is empty.

- `2026-07-16` `W34-E3-S4-T2` is complete: exact and dynamic route dispatch, static
